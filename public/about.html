    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a motivated and dedicated individual, currently expanding my skills in
      Web Development and continuously learning to enhance my technical
      expertise. With a background in Quality Assurance (QA), I bring hands-on
      experience in both Manual Testing and Automation using Appium and
      Selenium. My work in QA has helped me develop a keen eye for detail, a
      methodical approach to problem-solving, and a solid foundation in ensuring
      software quality.

      As a QA Tester, I've worked on ensuring the highest standards of software
      quality, focusing on identifying defects, validating functionality, and
      maintaining product consistency across different platforms and
      environments. My approach involves creating comprehensive test cases,
      executing thorough test scenarios, and effectively documenting results to
      ensure complete transparency and traceability.

      As an Automation Engineer, I’ve developed and executed automated test
      scripts to improve testing efficiency and accuracy. I’m skilled in using a
      variety of automation tools and frameworks, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Selenium: For Web Automation, creating robust scripts that simulate user
        interactions across different browsers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Appium: For Mobile Testing on both Android and iOS platforms, allowing
        me to ensure high-quality performance across devices.
      </li>
      <li>
        JUnit and TestNG: For structuring tests and managing test cases
        efficiently.
      </li>
      <li>MSTest: For running parallel tests in complex test environments.</li>
      <li>
        Postman and REST Assured: For API testing and validating endpoints.
      </li>
      <li>
        Jira and Azure DevOps: For tracking bugs, managing test cases, and
        collaborating with teams.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      As a young professional, I'm passionate about going the extra mile in
      everything I do, from meeting project goals to supporting my team. I value
      collaboration and am always eager to contribute to a positive, productive
      work environment. I’m committed to growing my skills and making a
      meaningful impact in each project I take on.
